				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<ul>
				   <li>
					<strong>Data Analytics Research Project</strong><br>
					<strong>Tools Used: SQL, Python, Excel, R, NLP</strong>
					
					<p>• The project explores how the electric range of EVs affects consumer purchase decisions and the necessity of charging
						infrastructure. Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to preprocess the dataset, handling null values and
						performing data transformations. Utilize Scikit-learn for advanced statistical analysis and predictive modeling, seaborn
						for more intricate visualizations, and Plotly for interactive charts and dashboards.</p>
					<p>• Leveraged R libraries like ggplot2 and dplyr for creating detailed visualizations and interpreting data trends across
						different EV models. Employed MySQL for querying and calculating descriptive statistics, including the minimum,
						maximum, and average electric ranges.</p>
				   </li>
				   <li>
					<strong>Loyalty First Program App</strong><br>
					<strong>SQL, HTML, CSS, Java, Android Studio, Apache Netbeans</strong>
					<p>• Developed a customer-centric Loyalty First program application, enabling users to accrue loyalty points with each
						purchase. To support this application, I meticulously crafted Java server-side code, implementing JDBC to seamlessly
						integrate the Java server-side components.</p>
					<p>• Designed and implemented customized SQL queries for server components, optimizing response parsing in the Android
						app. This initiative improved loyalty point processes and streamlined server-to-mobile communication, enhancing the
						overall user experience.</p>
