				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<ul>
				   <li>
					<strong>CI/CD Pipeline for Static Website Hosting on AWS</strong><br>
					<strong>S3, Code Pipeline, Code Build, GitHub, Yaml, Route 53</strong>
					<p>• Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild to automate the deployment of a static website
                                             hosted on AWS S3.</p>
					<p>• Configured the pipeline to integrate with a GitHub repository for seamless updates triggered by code pushes. Designed
                                             and utilized a custom buildspec.yml file to define build and deployment processes. Ensured secure and accessible hosting
                                             by managing S3 bucket permissions. This project enabled real-time updates to the live website, enhanced deployment
                                             efficiency, and improved troubleshooting through CodeBuild logs.</p>
				   </li>

				   <li>
					<strong>Deploying Three-tier Architecture on AWS</strong><br>
					<strong>EC2, RDS, AWS VPC, ELB, Subnets, CloudWatch</strong>
					<p>• Designed and implemented a highly available and fault-tolerant three-tier architecture using AWS VPC, load balancers,
                                             EC2 instances, and Amazon Aurora with read replicas for high availability and scalability.</p>
					<p>• Configured auto-scaling groups to manage EC2 instances based on traffic dynamically, ensuring optimal resource usage
                                             while adhering to AWS security best practices with IAM roles and security groups.</p>
					<p>• Deployed application code using S3 for storage and retrieval, set up required software environments on EC2, and
